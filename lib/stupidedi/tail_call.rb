  # This performs tail call optimization on methods declared by the programmer
  # to be in tail call form. It can't actually verify if they are, so be sure
  # to write tests for your methods.
  #
  # Because the optimizations are done in pure Ruby, the benefits are somewhat
  # limited -- the stack doesn't grow but it only begins to outperform the
  # unoptimized code only when the stack reaches a depth of about 5000 frames.
  # Before that threshold, it actually performs significantly worse -- about 70%
  # slower at 50 stack frames, and nearly 100% slower at 10 stack frames.
  #
  # @example
  #   class Unoptimized
  #     def fact(n, accumulator = 1)
  #       (n < 2) ? accumulator : fact(n-1, n * accumulator)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class Optimized
  #     include TailCall
  #
  #     def fact(n, accumulator = 1)
  #       (n < 2) ? accumulator : fact(n-1, n * accumulator)
  #     end
  #
  #     optimize_tailcall :fact
  #   end
  #
  # Benchmarks
  # ----------
  #     o = Optimized.new
  #     u = Unoptimized.new
  #
  #     [10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000].each do |n|
  #       Benchmark.bm do |x|
  #         x.report("#{n} optim = ") { puts(begin; o.fact(n).size; rescue; $! end) }
  #         x.report("#{n} plain = ") { puts(begin; u.fact(n).size; rescue; $! end) }
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # With 10000 stack frames the optimized version runs about 40% faster. These
  # benchmark results were produced by Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7

  # It seems like this tradeoff makes sense only for methods we know are going to
  # consistently generate thousands of stack frames. We're probably better off
  # using Ruby YARV (1.9) in all cases though, since it performs faster in general
  # and it supposedly implements tail call optimization in the interpreter.

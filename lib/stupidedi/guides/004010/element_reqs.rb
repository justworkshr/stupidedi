        # Declares that this element must always be sent. Required elements
        # within Situational segments when the segment occurs.
        #
        # Similarly, required component elements within situational composite
        # elements only occur when the composite element occurs.
        Required = Schema::ElementReq.new(true,  false, "R")

        # Use of this element varies, depending on data content and business
        # context as described in the defining rule. The defining rule is
        # documented in a Situational Rule attached to the element.
        #
        # There are two forms of Situational Rules. The first is "Required when
        # <condition>. If not required by <condition>, the element may be
        # provided at the discretion of the sender, but it cannot be required or
        # requested by the receiver.'
        #
        # The other form is "Required when <condition>. If not required by
        # <condition>, do not send". The element described by the rule cannot
        # occur except when the condition holds.
        Situational = Schema::ElementReq.new(false, false, "S")

        # This element must never be sent.
        NotUsed = Schema::ElementReq.new(false, true,  "N")

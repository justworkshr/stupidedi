        # There are two forms of Situational Rules. The first is "Required when
        # <condition>. If not required by <condition>, the segment may be
        # provided at the discretion of the sender, but it cannot be required or
        # requested by the receiver.'

        # The other form is "Required when <condition>. If not required by
        # <condition>, do not send". The segment described by the rule cannot
        # occur except when the condition holds.

    # The {ConstraintTable} is a data structure that contains one or more
    # {Instruction} values for the same segment identifier. Each concrete
    # subclass implements different strategies for narrowing down the
    # {Instruction} list.
    #
    # Reducing the number of valid {Instruction} values is important because
    # executing more than one {Instruction} creates a non-deterministic state --
    # more than one valid parse tree exists -- which slows the parser. Most
    # often there is only one valid {Instruction} but the parser cannot
    # (efficiently or at all) narrow the tree down without evaluating the
    # constraints declared by each {Instruction}'s {Schema::SegmentUse}, which
    # is done here.

    #
    # The functional group segments (GS/GE) and the segments contained by that
    # functional group are versioned separately from the interchange control
    # segments (ISA/ISE). The functional group version is informally referred to
    # as the EDI version (5010, 4010, etc). Each version indicates the segment
    # dictionary being used and the grammar of the functional group. Only the GS
    # and GE segments are described in the HIPAA guides, but the functional
    # group header and footer may consist of other segments.
    #
    # Because the interchange and functional group are versioned independently,
    # it may be possible, for instance, to send a 4010 transaction set within a
    # 5010 envelope, depending on forward- and backward-comatibility.

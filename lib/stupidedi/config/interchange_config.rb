    # The interchange control segments (ISA/ISE) are versioned independently
    # from the functional group segments (GS/GE). Because different interchange
    # versions can have unique grammars, this table serves as an indirection.
    #
    # Opinion: The interchange version is encoded within the ISA segment, whose
    # definition is recursively dependent on the interchange version. Worse yet,
    # the version is encoded as the fourteenth element (in versions 00501 and
    # 00401), instead of say, the 1st element.
    #
    # This seems to indicate the versioning was an afterthought. The same
    # thought process was applied when versioning the functional group segments,
    # which has the version encoded in GS08.
    #
    # The best we can do to cope with this is to presume the ISA and GS segments
    # have an underlying grammar that won't change between versions. We do this
    # by parsing 12 things following "ISA", using the 12th thing as the version
    # number, and then starting over at "ISA" and parsing with actual grammar.
    # Then the grammar can specify which elements specify delimiters and all the
    # other parts of the interchange header, like the TA1 segment.
    #
